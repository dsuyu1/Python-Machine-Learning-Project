# Python Machine Learning Project
## Introduction
In this project, I'll learn how to implement and use different machine-learning algorithms in Python. Python has always been a skill of mine that's been lacking, and what better way to learn about it than to do some hands-on projects? 

## Sections
#### 1. Linear Regression
#### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors Classification
#### 3. Support Vector Machines
#### 4. Decision Trees and Random Forest Classification
#### 5. K-Means Clustering
#### 6. Neural Networks
